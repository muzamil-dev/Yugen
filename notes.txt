- pyQT app stats with QApplication and we can only use it once in a app
- main window can be made by subclassing QMainWindow
    i.e.
    Class MainClass(QMainWindow):
- pyQt is widget based kind of like componets in webdev
- self. is how you can refrence the current object
    i.e.
    self.image_label = QLabel()
    is like setting .image_label to be used 
    then if you do
    image_label = QLabel()
- self.setWindowTitle("Title") sets the title of the window
- use QLable to display Text
